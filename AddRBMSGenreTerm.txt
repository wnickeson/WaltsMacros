'MacroDescription:Displays the list of RBMS genre terms to help find a term to add in a

' Please e-mail me with bug reports or to suggest improvements.
'
' This macro works for me with Connexion client 2.63 and 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works. Run this macro in a bibliographic record to access the list of RBMS genre
' terms in order to easily add a new term, or to quickly replace or verify an existing
' term. The list contains both authorized and reference terms. For each authorized term,
' the macro displays associated information--broader, narrower, and related terms (if
' any)--as well as the term's scope and use note and any terms for which the authorized
' form is used. Select any authorized term from the list to add it to the record.
'
' If the cursor is placed in a 650 or 655 field when the macro is run, the macro can
' replace the existing heading with the selected RBMS term. Subdivision subfields can be
' retained or deleted. Or a new 655 field can be added containing the selected authorized
' term, again with the option of copying any additional subdivision subfields from the
' existing heading. Or, use the cursor to highlight a word or phrase in the record, and
' run the macro to search for a matching RBMS term; if a term is found, the macro can add
' it in a new field. Or simply run the macro with the cursor anywhere else in the record
' to find, by searching or browsing, a suitable authorized term from the list, and to add
' that term in a new field, regardless of what is already present in the record.
'
' All new or replaced fields are tagged "655 #7" and include subfield $2 "rbgenr".
'
' The macro displays the complete list (both authorized and reference terms, in a single
' alphabetical sequence) in 25-term pages in the main list box. Other list boxes display
' associated terms--broader, narrow, and related. Click on any term in any list box to
' view that term's scope and use note, if present, as well as its associated terms. If
' the selected term is a reference, the macro shows the authorized term it refers to. Or,
' use the search box to find a specific term. Begin entering a search term, and as you
' type, the macro adjusts the list box to show the alphabetically closest term surrounded
' by its 12 neighbors on either side. Stop typing, and after a brief pause the macro will
' display information associated with that closest matching term. With an authorized term
' selected, click the "Add field" button to add it in a new field; click the "Replace
' field" button to replace the field (if the cursor was initially placed in a 650 or 655
' field) with the authorized term.
'
' Limitations in the OCLC macro language mean the dialog box can't display all the
' authorized terms for browsing in a single, scrollable list. The maximum size of the
' array that can be shown in a list box seems to be a little over 8000 characters. The
' number of rows displayed depends on the number of characters in the rows. (Plugging my
' test results into Excel shows me that the equation that best fits the numbers is
' y = 10562 * x^-1.058, where y = number of rows shown, and x = mean length of the row.
' The R-squared value for this equation is 0.9949.) This restriction would mean a
' display of perhaps only two thirds of the terms. The solution I have adopted is for the
' macro to display a page of 25 terms at a time, with forward and back buttons in order
' to be able to go through the whole list. This number allows room enough for browsing
' the list while keeping the dialog box to a manageable size, and the dynamic updating of
' the list of 25 terms as characters are entered into the search box makes it easy to
' jump to any part of the alphabet.

Sub DoSearch( InputString$ )

' This function searches the list of terms to find a match to the input string. If the
' input string came from a selection in a list box, an exact match will always be found,
' and it will be either an authorized term or a reference to that term. However, if the
' input string came from the search box, the situation is a bit more complex. Because a
' search is always executed each time a character is added to or deleted from the search
' box, the search string will always, at least at first, never match a term exactly. Most
' likely it will match several terms in the list that start with the same characters,
' until the search string becomes long enough to either match one term (completely or
' partially) or nothing at all. If an exact match isn't found, this search finds the
' leftmost of several matches, or the position in the array in which a matching term
' would appear if it existed. In such a case the search is over, because there is no
' authorized term (or even a reference term) to find. On the other hand, if the match is
' exact, the matching term is either the authorized RBMS term or a reference to it. If
' the matching term is a reference, the authorized term it refers to is extracted from
' the "Remainders" array and becomes the input string for another iteration of the
' search. The first search will therefore always return a number which is the index of
' the (closest) matching term, and only sometimes return a number which is the index of
' the authorized term. The second search, when run, always returns a number which is the
' index of the authorized term.

' This code for the special case of a binary search--finding the leftmost of duplicated
' entries in the array--is adapted from the article "Binary search algorithm" on
