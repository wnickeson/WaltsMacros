' MacroName:JumpToAAP.2025.01
' MacroDescription:Moves the cursor in a bibliographic record to the field containing the
' authorized access point (1XX or 245), and adjusts the display of a lengthy record to
' put that field at or near the top of the Connexion client main window.
'
' This macro was written by Walter F. Nickeson and last updated 3 May 2025.
' It was developed in Connexion client 3.1 running in Windows 11 Enterprise and 64-bit
' Windows 10 Pro.

' How it works: Run the macro in a bibliographic record to move the cursor to the 1XX or
' 245 field (the first field of the authorized access point). The macro runs through all
' the records in the field, noting which line contains the AAP (the 1XX or 245 field),
' until it reaches the last line. It moves the cursor there. If the last line is outside,
' or below, the main window, that cursor movement forces the record up in the display to
' make it visible. The macro immediately moves the cursor again to the line with the AAP.
' If that field has been pushed up, outside the main window, the Client moves the record
' down in the display, in order to make the AAP visible. The end result may be that some
' or all of the 0XX fields are outside the main window, but the purpose of the macro is
' to help you see right away as much as possible of the body of the record, that is, the
' descriptive data.
'
' If the whole record already fits in the main window, all the macro does is put the
' cursor in the 1XX or 245 field.
'
' It makes no difference in the functioning of this macro how the fixed field is
' displayed, whether it is at the top or bottom, or shown as a variable field.

' Then go through the record, line by line, checking the tag (which is why the

' fields in non-Latin scripts). Keep track of which field contains the 1XX field (if
' present) or 245 field, as that's where the cursor will end up. When the last row of the
' record is found, put the cursor there, which will force the record up in the window;
' then finish the macro by jumping to the field identified earlier that contains the
' (beginning of) the authorized access point, either the 1XX or 245 field. This may force
