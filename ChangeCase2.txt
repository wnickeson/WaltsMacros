'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: Run the macro in a bibliographic or authority record to change the case
' of selected text in a field, or, if nothing is selected, to change the case of all the
' text in the whole field in which the cursor is located. The selection or field must be
' in Latin script.
'
' These are the six options for changing case:
'
'   lowercase:     all letters are made lowercase.
'
'   UPPERCASE:     ALL LETTERS ARE MADE UPPERCASE (EXCEPT SUBFIELD CODES).
'
'   Sentence case: What is a sentence? A sentence is a string of characters that ends
'                  with a period (full stop), a question mark, or an exclamation point,
'                  with or without following quotation marks. The first letter of the
'                  string is capitalized; all other letters are made lowercase. No
'                  terminal punctuation is added.
'
'   Initial Capitals Case:
'                  Every Letter That Follows A Space, Or Other Non-Word Character, Is
'                  Capitalized. All Other Letters Are Made Lowercase. An Apostrophe Is
'                  Considered A Word Character, So If It Is Used Other Than To Mark
'                  Possessive Case Or An Abbreviation The Result Will Be Incorrect:
'                  Watch Out For The Macro Turning "O'Brien" Into "O'brien," For Example.
'
'   Title Case:    Every Letter That Follows a Space, or Other Non-Word Character, Is
'                  Capitalized. However, following the Chicago Manual of Style Guidelines
'                  for "Headline-Style Capitalization," Articles, Coordinate
'                  Conjunctions, and Prepositions Are Made Lowercase--Except that Every
'                  Word that Begins a Sentence Is Capitalized. The Prepositions Included
'                  in This Macro's List Are Taken from Wikipedia's List of Single-Word
'                  Prototypical English Prepositions, Viewed 23 June 2023.
'
'   Contents case: All titles in a contents note (505) are made into Sentence case, and
'                  statements of responsibility are made into Initial Capitals. However,
'                  the only way this change of case can succeed is if the field's
'                  components are correctly identified, either by subfield coding (in an
'                  enhanced contents note) or by ISBD punctuation. While the option to
'                  use Contents case conversion is offered for any contents field, if the
'                  note is not enhanced, or ISBD punctuation is not present, the result
'                  may not be what was intended. Note that this case option applies only
'                  to an entire field, not to a selection. Select only portions of a
'                  contents note to change case in a 505 field in other ways.
'
'                  In an enhanced contents note, subfields $t and $r identify strings
'                  that the macro converts to Sentence case and Initial Capitals case,
'                  respectively. Strings in subfield $g are simply ignored, as is ISBD
'                  punctuation. In other contents notes, the whole string between marks
'                  of ISBD punctuation is changed, which could mean that information that
'                  might appear in a subfield $g in an enhanced note, such as volume or
'                  part numbering or naming, or durations of works that include words or
'                  abbreviations, may have its case changed incorrectly. In either kind
'                  of note, in a record for an English language resource, the word "by"
'                  that introduces a statement of responsibility is made lowercase, as is
'                  a preceding word like "edited" or "compiled" (rare though that may
'                  be).
'
' For the four options other than lowercase and UPPERCASE, letters between periods
' without spaces, such as those in abbreviations or initials, are capitalized. Thus,
' "u.s.a." is converted to "U.S.A.", and "j.r.r." (as in "Tolkien") is made "J.R.R."
' Initialisms or acronyms without periods are treated as words and will be converted as
' such. "NASA" might become "nasa" or "Nasa", for example, depending on the conversion
' option chosen. Spaces between the initials also make the letters become sentences, so
' "u. s. a." may become "u. S. A." if Sentence case is selected and the preceding
' character is not a period.
'
' The lowercase and UPPERCASE options (which are used by the other choices) add a space
' before and after each delimiter and subfield code, if necessary.
'
' Two characters are treated specially, following Unicode practice as described in
' section 5.18 of the Unicode Standard, "Case mappings":
'
'  + Small letter sharp s "ß", or esszet, is uppercased to "SS", and capital sharp s is
'    lowercased to small sharp s.
'
'  + Letter i: If the language of the resource is Turkish, according to the fixed field
'    element "Lang":
'     - Latin small letter i is uppercased to capital I with dot above;
'     - Latin capital letter I is lowercased to Latin small letter dotless i;
'     - Latin capital letter I with dot above is lowercased to plain Latin small letter
'       i.
'    For all other languages, Latin capital letter I is lowercased to Latin small letter
'    i, and conversely, i is uppercased to I.
'
' This macro respects the "titlecase" property of the four Latin Unicode characters that
' possess it. For example, the Latin capital letter "DZ", which has lowercase form "dz",
' also has titlecase form "Dz", for use when the letter begins a title. The other Latin
' Unicode letters with titlecase property are LJ, NJ, and DZ with a caron over the Z.
'
' Because of the possibility that some text may be converted that should not be, such as
' acronyms and abbreviations, proper nouns, URIs, and so on, select text carefully, and
' review closely the results of this macro's operation.
'
' Terminology used in this documentation:
'
'  + "ASCII" includes both the original 7-bit, 128-character set ("Basic Latin" in
'    Unicode), and extended ASCII, in the form of the Windows-1252 character set.
'    Extended ASCII includes many composite, or accented, characters, chiefly from
'    Western European languages. Code points for ASCII are usually given in decimal form.
'
'  + "MARC" may mean MARC-8, the original character set for the MARC format, or OCLC-
'    MARC, the slightly different flavor used in OCLC records. This documentation makes
'    the distinction explicit where necessary. MARC includes Basic Latin and its own
'    version of extended ASCII, which is also known as the American National Standard for
'    Extended Latin, or ANSEL. The MARC repertoire does not include composite characters,
'    instead providing combining characters (usually diacritical marks) in ANSEL that are
'    associated with base characters. Note that although MARC-8 specifies that
'    combining characters appear before the letters they apply to, Connexion requires
'    they be input after, as does Unicode. (A record exported in MARC-8 confirms that the
'    Client adheres to the proper order of characters, even if it is the reverse of what
'    appears in the editor.) Code points for MARC are usually given in decimal form.
'
'  + "Unicode" is the Universal Character Set, which includes ASCII and everything
'    beyond. The Unicode repertoire includes both composite and combined (that is, able
'    to be decomposed) characters. This macro restricts its operation to Latin
'    characters, which are found in Unicode blocks Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin
'    Extended-A through -E, and Latin Extended Additional. Characters in the blocks Latin
'    Extended-F and -G contain no characters with case. Code points for Unicode are
'    always given as hexadecimal digits.
'
'  + "Numeric Character Reference", or NCR, is a way of representing Unicode code points
'    as strings. It is simply the four- or five hexadecimal digit Unicode code point
'    prefixed with "&#x" and suffixed with ";". This is how Unicode characters are
'    entered into Connexion. An NCR is the same as an HTML entity.
'
' The macro can simply apply the macro language commands UCase and LCase to original
' ASCII letters, including MARC characters composed of base characters followed by
' diacritical marks. Extended ASCII letters have their case changed by first being made
' Unicode, because Connexion will otherwise turn many of those code points into different
' OCLC-MARC characters when the changed field is added back to the record. Characters
' encoded as Unicode, whether having been converted from ASCII or being original to the
' record, remain in Unicode, and have their case converted by using lookup tables. These
' tables are arrays that are made up of letters in the Unicode Latin blocks.
'
' Five pairs of unrelated characters share decimal code points, a feature of OCLC-MARC
' that may cause this macro to produce incorrect results. The code points, with the
' OCLC-MARC and ASCII characters they encode, are:
'
'   - 200  Inverted question mark          Latin capital letter E with grave
'   - 201  Inverted exclamation point      Latin capital letter E with acute
'   - 202  Copyright sign                  Latin capital letter E with circumflex
'   - 203  Sound recording copyright sign  Latin capital letter E with diaeresis
'   - 204  Musical sharp sign              Latin capital letter I with grave
'
' It's impossible for this macro to know whether any one of these code points represents
' an accented capital letter or a punctuation mark or symbol. Arbitarily, it considers
' the character to be a letter. Unfortunately, that means a lowercase operation on the
' character may produce something completely wrong. (An uppercase operation that would
' result in that code point actually produces a Unicode character, which is unambiguous;
' the problem is therefore one-way.) Similarly, Connexion will consider the character at
' one of those five code points to be a punctuation mark or symbol--not a letter--and
' force it to appear thus. This problem is partly mitigated by the effect described
' below, when a Unicode character is added to a field before a "GetUnicodeField" command.
' In such a situation the last two characters on the list are apparently transformed into
' their Unicode code points, and confusion is avoided.
'
' Characters are neither decomposed nor combined when their case is changed.
'
' Depending on the font used, some characters, although valid, may not be displayed
' properly.

' Joel Hahn, in his "CvtDiacritics" macro, shows that when using the "GetFieldUnicode"
' command, inserting a Unicode character into the field before invoking the command
' changes the way combining characters, such as diacritical marks, are shown to be
' encoded. Those combining marks are encoded in OCLC-MARC in the decimal range 224-254
' (hex E0-FF). However, when a Unicode character is added to the field, they show as
' being encoded in Unicode, in the range U+0300-U+036F. The delimiter sign--the alveolar
' click--also appears to have its encoding changed, from decimal 223 to U+01C2. My
' experiments suggest the hex value of the inserted Unicode character that causes this
' change in behavior must be above 36F. Therefore, this macro inserts the character
' "GREEK ANO TELEIA" (U+0387), which appears as a middle dot, as the first character in
