'MacroDescription:Helps with verifying, adding, replacing, and deleting MARC relator
' codes and terms, singly and en masse.

' Check for the latest versions of this and my other macros at

' Please e-mail me with bug reports or to suggest improvements.
'
' This macro works for me with Connexion client 3.1 and 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: Run this macro in a bibliographic record to help quickly and easily:
'
'  + Add a correct term to one or more fields;
'  + Verify accuracy of the record's relator terms and codes;
'  + Add terms to fields containing only codes (and vice versa);
'  + Replace terms with codes (and vice versa);
'  + Replace incorrect terms with their preferred forms;
'  + Replace unknown terms with valid terms;
'  + Delete terms or codes.
'
' ("Terms" and "codes" are MARC; this macro does not work with RDA terms from Appendix
' I.)
'
' If no fields are selected, and the cursor is not in a heading field when the macro is
' run, the macro shows the relator terms and codes present in subfields $e, $j, and $4 of
' the 1XX, 6XX, 7XX, and 8XX fields of the record. It identifies incorrect and unknown
' terms for appropriate replacement, and allows for adding terms to matching codes and
' codes to matching terms, as well as swapping codes for terms and terms for codes.
'
' If several fields have been selected, the macro can add a relator term to them all.
' Select the fields by clicking and dragging with the mouse, or by using the [SHIFT] and
' [UP] and [DOWN] arrow keys, then run the macro, selecting a term to add from the drop-
' down list presented. This feature is especially useful when multiple headings require
' the same relator term, as for records for visual materials (e.g., "actor") and sound
' recordings (e.g., "performer"). The macro won't add a term to fields where it is
' already present.
'
' If the cursor is in a heading field when the macro is run, and no fields are selected,
' the options presented are to add a new term to the field or to correct an invalid or
' unknown term. When several relator terms are present in the field, the macro allows for
' scrolling through them for verification. An incorrect term will be displayed first for
' correction.
'
' Although only terms can be added to multiple fields, the terms can be converted to
' codes, or have their corresponding codes added, by running the macro a second time, but
' without selecting fields.
'
' You can enter a partial term in a subfield $e in a single heading and run the macro to
' view the closest match to that fragment, and let the macro do the work of inserting the
' whole, correct form--saving a bit of typing.
'
' The macro attempts to correct punctuation when adding and deleting terms and codes, but
' the results may not be what is expected, and so should always be checked.
'
' The list of codes and terms is at http://www.loc.gov/marc/relators/
