' This macro works for me with Connexion client 3.1 and 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: This macro deletes contiguous variable fields from a record in the Client
' without your having to worry about precise cursor placement in selecting those fields.
' Click anywhere in the first field to delete, and extend the selection by dragging
' straight down across all the fields you wish to delete, ending anywhere in the cell
' containing the last field to be deleted. (You can also select by dragging backward, or
' up.) You don't have to click at the beginning of the tag in the first field, and end
' the selection with the last character in the last field, or vice-versa. The macro
' deletes the whole of the fields in which the selection begins and ends (even though
' they may be only partially highlighted), and all fields in between. If only part of a
' cell has been selected, the whole field is deleted. The macro cannot delete lines that
' contain non-Latin script characters. Empty fields are another problem: If the selection
' consists only of empty fields, they will all be deleted; if the empty fields are at the
' end of the block of selected fields, all selected fields will be deleted; but if the
' block of selected fields begins with one or more empty fields, those empty fields will
' not be deleted, although the non-empty ones will be.
'
' The end-of-field marker in Connexion is the ASCII character pair 13 + 10, or Carriage
' return + Line feed. The macro looks at the text that has been selected for end-of-field
' markers to figure out how many fields it spans. Text containing no end-of-field markers
' may indicate a selection within a single field, or a selection of empty fields (e.g.,
' if the text in those fields has been cut to paste in elsewhere). In the latter case,
' the number of fields selected is calculated by counting the number of tags found. The
' macro then uses the "DeleteFieldLine" command to delete that number of whole fields,
' starting with the first one. Using the macro command to cut whole fields gets around
' the problem of the <DELETE> key deleting only the characters (as opposed to fields)
' that have been selected; as the Client functions now, to delete whole fields, the
' entire text of all the fields must be carefully selected, which requires more physical
' coordination and thought than it ought.
