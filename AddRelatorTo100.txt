'MacroDescription:Automatically adds a relator term in subfield $e to the 100 field of a
' bibliographic record, according to the Type of record.

' This macro works for me with Connexion client 3.1 and 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: Run the macro in a bibliographic record (cursor position is irrelevant)
' to instantly add a relator term to the 100 field. The term added is determined by the
' type of record, as identified in the fixed field:
'
'  Language material (Type "a", "t", "i"): "author"
'  Music (Type "j", "c", "d"): "composer"
'  2D non-projected graphic (Type "k"): "artist"
'  Cartographic material (Type "e", "f"): "cartographer"
'
' For any other type of material, or for any other heading field, the macro won't attempt
' to add a relator term. The macro adds a term even when a different relator term is
' already present in the 100 field. If the corresponding relator code in subfield $4 is
' present, the macro asks if the code should be deleted when adding the term.
