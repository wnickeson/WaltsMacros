'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: With the cursor in the field to be copied, run the macro. It copies the
' entire field (tag, indicators, and data) and inserts the copy as a new field directly
' below the original.
'
' My macro "DuplicateFieldPlus" also copies individual fields but makes some useful
' changes as it does so.
