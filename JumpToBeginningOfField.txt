' How it works: Run the macro to move the cursor to the beginning of the field in which
' the cursor is placed, that is, to before the first digit of the tag. OCLC has
' programmed the Client so that pressing the keyboard's [HOME] key moves the cursor to
' the beginning of whatever cell the cursor is in, not to the absolute beginning of the
' field, which is the tag. That means that if the cursor is in the cell containing the
' field's actual data, several keystrokes are needed to put the cursor at the beginning
' of the cell containing the tag. This simple macro eliminates those keystrokes. It also
' doesn't end by selecting the tag, as does simply clicking in the tag's cell.
