'MacroName:CutterMaker2.2023.31
'MacroDescription:Creates an alphanumeric Cutter, or a numeric Cutter to fit into a
' specified range, for selected or copied text, with an option to paste the output
' directly into a call number field. Supplies a Cutter from LC's tables for U.S. states,
' Canadian provinces, and certain other governments and geographic areas.

'
' This macro works for me with Connexion client 3.1 and 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: Select a text string in a Connexion record and run the macro to generate
' a Cutter number derived from that string. Or, place the cursor in a heading field in a
' bibliographic record that contains a geographic entity or jurisdiction and run the
' macro to retrieve the standard LC Cutter number (if established) for that entity. Or,
' copy some text from any source to the Clipboard and run the macro to generate a Cutter
' from it. (Whatever its origin, all copied text must be in Latin script.) This macro is
' designed to help quickly add information to a call number field, but it doesn't need to
' run in a bibliographic record, as the Cutter it creates can be copied to any
' destination. If the macro is run in a bibliographic record, it offers to add the Cutter
' it creates at the end of a call number field, or it can put that string on the
' Clipboard for pasting.
'
' For any selected text, the macro calculates, following LC's published guidelines, a
' two- to four-character Cutter. The macro ignores case, punctuation, and diacritics in
' its calculation, and uses only the the first four alphanumeric characters. A space or a
' period will be considered by the macro to be the end of the selection. Some special
' characters are converted to their nearest Latin alphabet equivalents; for example, the
' letter "o" with slash ("ø") is considered to be a simple "o" by the macro. Text copied
' from outside Connexion--that is, that uses the Windows character set rather than MARC-
' OCLC--that contains diacritical marks or special characters may produce strange
' results. The default output of the macro is a Cutter consisting of the first letter of
' the selection, followed by one to four digits representing the succeeding characters.
' If the selection begins with a digit, or is composed of only digits, the macro creates
' a Cutter beginning with the letter "A" which will place it in the span A12-A19.

' The macro can also calculate a Cutter to fit into any range. Usually this will be a
' string of digits, rather than an alphanumeric string. For example, if the text selected
' is the word "general," the macro's default result is "G46", but it also offers the
' numeric string "4137." The macro offers shortcuts for the specific ranges used in Table
' P-PZ40. For example, Cuttering the word "apple" produces not only "A67", but for a
' literature call number that uses that table, the other Cutters generated are "A882" (to
' fit into the range A61-A9999) and "Z552" (to fit into the range Z4581-Z9999).
' Similarly, Cuttering the string "zither" results in the options "Z58," "Z271," and
' "Z99." But it can also generate a Cutter beginning with a letter to fit into any range.
'
' To fit a number into a range: Enter in each of the macro's two text input boxes up to
' four digits, for the lower and upper limits of the range. If fewer than four digits are
' entered, the macro pads the number for the lower end of the range with 0 (zero), and
' the number for the upper end with 9. For example, entering the range limits of "1" and
' "4" in the dialog box will generate a Cutter falling between 1000 and 4999 (see
' Classification and Shelflisting Manual (July 2013) section G58, "Interpreting the
' Classification Schedules"). To force the number generated to be only up to, but not
' including, 4, enter "4000" or "3999" as the upper limit. For example, to fit the word
' "Life" into the range allotted by LC Classification Table P-PZ38 for "Autobiography,
' journals, memoirs. By title", enter as the upper and lower limits of the range "8" and
' "829" and run the macro to receive the suggestion "8152".
'
' If a bibliographic record is open but no text is selected, and the cursor is in any
' 110, 610, 650, 651, or 710 field that contains a geographic area or jurisdiction for
' which a Cutter has been established in either the "Regions and Countries Table" (CSM
' section G300) or the "U.S. States and Canadian Provinces" table (CSM section G302),
' the macro will offer that Cutter for use. For a geographic heading followed by a
' smaller or contained geographic area (for example, "Minnesota $z Mesabi Range"), the
' macro takes only the first entity from which to generate a Cutter. It can also extract
' a geographic Cutter from some qualifiers, such as "Cambridge (England)", and "Cuyuna
' (Minn.)". (Abbreviations are only recognized for U.S. states and Canadian provinces.)
' Non-LC subject fields may not contain authorized headings, so the macro may not be able
' to find a Cutter for a heading in such a field.
'
' If no text is selected, and the cursor is not in a heading field, or a bibliographic
' record is not displayed, the macro will try to use whatever it finds on the Clipboard
' to create a Cutter.
'
' Regular Cutters are generated following LC's published guidelines (see CSM G63, "Cutter
' Numbers"). Cutters that must fit into a range are generated using a table of frequency
' of occurence for letters in the English language. To get the range into which to fit
' the Cutter, the limits are padded to four digits as explained above, and then shrunk
' slightly to allow for modification at each end. Thus, although the limits of a range
' might be entered as 1-4, the range in which the macro does its calculation is actually
' 1200-4919, or a span of 3719. The process by which the macro does this is explained
' more fully below in the comments introducing the function "CalculateBaseCutter."
'
' It should go without saying that the Cutters produced by the macro are suggestions
' only, and should be rounded up or down, or shortened or lengthened, as appropriate, to
' fit into specific shelflists. Also, the macro may generate a Cutter that ends with "1",
' which LC recommends against, and which therefore should be omitted or considered for
' rounding to fit a particular situation. The macro will not produce a Cutter that ends
' with zero.
'
' After creating a Cutter, if a bibliographic record is open the macro shows a list of
' all the call number fields (050, 055, 060, 070, 090, and 099) in the record, to paste
' the Cutter at the end of one of them. If there are several such fields, the macro tries
' to present as the default selection a field which doesn't already have a Cutter; but
' any call number field in the record may be selected. If the call number field ends with
' a blank subfield $b, the macro prefixes the Cutter with a decimal point; if there is no
' delimiter "$b", the macro provides one; otherwise, it does not try to format the call
' number. Use my macro "FormatCallNumber" to quickly format the call number
' appropriately. Or, the Cutter may be copied to the Clipboard, for pasting into a field
' at a specific position, or into another application.

Function CalculateBaseCutter( StringInput$, RangeSpan% ) As Integer

' This function calculates a base Cutter for the input string by using a table of
' relative frequencies of occurrence of the letters in the English alphabet. (Digits have
' been arbitrarily squeezed in at the beginning of the table.) For example, the
' relative frequency with which the letter "a" appears is 8.167%, that for the letter "b"
' is 1.492%, and so on. The way this table is used by this macro is to consider that
' titles beginning with the letter "a" will on average consist of the first 8,167 of a
' collection of 100,000 titles arranged in alphabetical order (except for a small space
' reserved for digits at the very beginning of the shelves), those beginning with "b"
' will take up the next 1,492, or titles 8,168 to 9,659, and so on. (Letter frequencies
' for beginnings of words differ from those for all occurrences, a distinction ignored in
' this macro.) So a title beginning with the letter "n" will be shelved, so to speak,
' after all the titles beginning with the letters "a" through "m"--a group that accounts
' for 54.055% (or the first 54,055) of all the titles. If there were 5,000 books, this
' title would be shelved in the 337 books whose titles also begin with "n" that are
' shelved between numbers 2703 and 3040. In other words, if the range into which to
' squeeze the Cutter is 5, then an appropriate Cutter for such a title would be between
' 2.70275 and 3.04020. The numbers in the rest of the Cutter depend on what follows the
' letter "n." For the title "new", the letter "e" would be between 16.694% and 29.396% of
' 0.33745. This calculation runs until four digits have been generated. This table of
' letter frequencies (there are others with different numbers) is from the Department of
' Mathematics and Computer Science at Oxford College of Emory University
' <https://mathcenter.oxford.emory.edu/site/math125/englishLetterFreqs/> and was viewed
