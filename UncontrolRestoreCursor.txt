' How it works: Run this macro to uncontrol a heading but keep the cursor where it was.
'
' The menu command Edit>Control Headings>Uncontrol Single (or the corresponding shortcut
' keys [CTRL-F11]) moves the cursor to the beginning of the field when the heading is
' made uncontrolled. Sometimes that's an inconvenience, such as when a subdivision is to
' be added to the field, because then the cursor has to be moved to the point of
' insertion. This macro deals with that inconvenience by simply storing the position of
' the cursor when the macro is run, and then moving the cursor back to that position
' after the heading has been uncontrolled. If the cursor is placed in the controlled
' field in the position where data is to be entered, the macro presents the uncontrolled
' field ready for data entry.
