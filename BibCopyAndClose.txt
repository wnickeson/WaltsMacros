' This macro works for me with Connexion client 3.1 and 64-bit Windows 10 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'***************************************************************************************#
' How it works: Run the macro while viewing a bibliographic record you want to make a
' copy of (cursor position is irrelevant). The macro makes a copy of the record, using
' the "DeriveNewRecord" command. By default, it transfers the fixed field values to the
' copy, but that action can be changed by changing the variable "CopyFixedField" on line
' 41 below to "FALSE". The macro then closes the window with the original record. If
' other windows are present, the macro finishes by making the window with the copied
' record the topmost window.
'
' The macro works by getting the title of the window of the original record. After making
' a copy of that record, it then goes through all the Client windows, comparing the title
' of each one to the title of the window it started with. When it finds that original
' window it closes it and quits. All other windows are simply ignored.
