'MacroName:CopyRecordToClipboard.2018.26
'MacroDescription:Copies the displayed record, or a selection of fields in that record,
' to the Windows Clipboard, using only characters in ISO-8859-1.
'
' This macro was originally written by OCLC for its Passport for Windows software with
' the name "SaveScreen." It was converted for the Connexion client by Joel Hahn, Niles
' Public Library District, with the name "SaveRecordAsFile," to write the displayed
' record to a text file. I re-wrote Joel's version of 4 February 2004 to be able to copy
' a record to the Windows Clipboard for easy printing or emailing.
'
' This macro by Joel Hahn was re-written by Walter F. Nickeson,
' University of Rochester, Rochester, NY

' Check for the latest versions of this and my other macros at
' https://github.com/wnickeson/WaltsMacros
' Please e-mail me with bug reports or to suggest improvements.
'
' This macro works for me with Connexion client 2.63 and 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: Run the macro with a bibliographic or authority record displayed. The
' macro puts the record on the Windows Clipboard, for pasting into a word processing
' program, for example, or into an e-mail. The copied text contains only characters in
' the ISO-8859-1 character set, which most applications and fonts should be able to cope
' with. However, because of the limitations of that character set, the copied record may
' be only an approximation of the original. The intent of this macro is to produce a
' useful, rather than an exact, copy.
'
' If nothing in the record is selected, the whole record is copied. If two or more
' contiguous fields have been selected, even if not completely, only those fields are
' copied. If only part of a single field is selected, that field only is copied to the
' Clipboard. A selection (whether of a single field or of several fields) that contains
' non-Latin script is not copyable. In this case, the macro offers the option of copying
' the whole record instead.
'
' The first line of the copied text identifies the source of the record--WorldCat,
' Authority File, Save File (including the save file number), or Constant Data. The
' record itself is presented as displayed on the screen, with the fixed field with its
' mnemonics either at the top or the bottom, or displayed as a variable field. If the
' fixed field shows at the top, the copied record is laid out in the classic OCLC record
' display, and if a monospaced font is used, the layout is properly spaced and aligned.
'
' Characters in the record not in the ISO-8859-1 character set--anything encoded with a
' hex value greater than 100, or UTF-8 C480--are converted to equivalent characters, if
' possible. These conversions are generally made on the basis of visual similarity,
' rather than of logical appropriateness. The vertical bar "|" is used to represent
' characters for which no appropriate substitute is available. Conversions or
' substitutions made by this macro include:
'
'  + Delimiters are represented to dollar signs. The dollar sign in subfield $c in the
'    066 field, part of a code indicating the presence of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean
'    script, is doubled, as otherwise it would look like subfield "one". Elsewhere, the
'    context should make it apparent which dollar signs actually represent themselves.
'  + Fill characters are converted to asterisks.
'  + Characters in the record modified with diacritical marks are represented by their
'    unmodified forms (that is, the diacritics are simply omitted) if they have no
'    precomposed equivalent in the character set.
'  + Most joined letters (including those connected with ligatures) are represented by
'    their separated components.
'  + The sound recording copyright symbol is represented by the letter "p".
'  + The musical flat sign is converted to the word "[flat]".
'  + Superscript and subscript numbers and symbols are converted to normal forms.
'
' Script direction is always displayed in the copied record or field as left-to-right.
' (Characters in scripts written from right to left generally won't display anyway.)
'
' Links between fields, shown in the client by a bracket connecting the two fields, can't
' be displayed by the macro.
'
' A brief warning about any conversion issues is included in the copied text.
'
' Because of the limitations of OCLC's macro language, a record longer than about 32K
' characters is beyond the capabilities of this macro. The record is stored in a single
' string, whose length cannot be greater than 32,767 characters; but OML has a memory
' limit somewhat less than that.
'
' Characters with code points 32 to 127 are common to all versions of ASCII, as well as
' ISO-8559-1 and OCLC-MARC; this macro will copy them exactly. Characters with code
' points 128 to 255 are encoded in OCLC-MARC, which is quite different from the encoding
' of ISO-8559-1. Some characters will copy exactly but most will be approximations.
' Diacritics in OCLC-MARC only appear if their combination with a base character matches
' a precomposed character in ISO-8559-1; if not, only the base character is kept. Code
' points below 32 should not appear in MARC records, but due to a bug in OML described
' below, they may occasionally be found. This macro substitutes the character "¤" for
' them. Code points above 255 are Unicode characters. These should be encoded in a MARC
' record as Numeric Character References (NCR). An NCR has the form "&#x????;", where the
' four characters "????" make up the character's Unicode code point. Almost none of these
' characters (which number more than a million) will have a direct ISO-8859-1 equivalent.
' A few can be approximated, but most will simply not be able to display, and so are
' represented by this macro by a vertical bar "|".
'
' The macro gets the record's data with the "GetFieldLineUnicode" command. This command
' retrieves Unicode characters encoded as NCRs. Joel Hahn has uncovered a bug in the
' command: It appears that it is not entirely reliable in retrieving NCRs, and sometimes
' returns a code point below 32. This macro considers such characters to be incorrectly
' encoded--even though they may display correctly on screen--and displays them in the
' copied text with the currency sign "¤". Unfortunately, the bug may affect display of
' the surrounding characters in the copied text; those neighboring characters may simply
' disappear from the copied text. Valid NCRS are converted to ISO-8859-1 by means of a
' table that matches those Unicode characters to ISO-8859-1 characters. This table
' contains 898 Unicode characters that may be represented, more or less closely, by
' ISO-8859-1 characters, drawn from these Unicode charts: Basic Latin, Latin-1
' Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B, Latin Extended-C, Latin Extended-D,
' Latin Extended-E, Latin Extended Additional, and General Punctuation.
'
' The macro makes note of the three cases in which the correspondence between the
' record's characters and the ISO-8859-1 set is not exact, although it does not identify
' any specific occurrence of a case. These situations are when a diacritic is unable to
' be represented in combination with a base character, when a character has only an
' approximate equivalent, and when a character has no appropriate representation at all.
'
' If a selection includes non-Latin characters, the OML command "CS.GetSelectedText"
' returns the value "Data contains non-latin script", no matter how many fields have been
' selected. Because there is no data to copy in the selection, the macro can only offer
' to copy the whole record instead.
