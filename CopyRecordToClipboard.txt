' MacroName:CopyRecordToClipboard.2025.01
' MacroDescription:Copies the displayed record, or a selection of fields in that record,
' to the Windows Clipboard in the classic layout, using only characters in ISO/IEC
' 8859-1:1998.
'
' This macro was written by Walter F. Nickeson and last updated 3 May 2025.
' It was developed in Connexion client 3.1 running in Windows 11 Enterprise and 64-bit
' Windows 10 Pro.
' Walt's macros for the Connexion client: https://github.com/wnickeson/WaltsMacros
' wfnickeson@zohomail.com
'
' This macro was originally written by OCLC for its Passport for Windows software with
' the name "SaveScreen." It was converted for the Connexion client by Joel Hahn, Niles
' Public Library District, with the name "SaveRecordAsFile," to write the displayed
' record to a text file. I re-wrote Joel's version of 4 February 2004 to be able to copy
' a record to the Windows Clipboard for easy printing or emailing.

' How it works: Run the macro with a bibliographic or authority record displayed. The
' macro puts the record on the Windows Clipboard, for pasting into a word processing
' program, for example, or into an e-mail. The copied text contains only characters
' encoded in ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998, which most applications and fonts should be able to
' cope with. However, because of the limitations of that character set, the copied
' record may be only an approximation of the original. The intent of this macro is to
' produce a useful, rather than an exact, copy.
'
' If nothing in the record is selected, the whole record is copied. If two or more
' contiguous fields have been selected, even if not completely, only those fields are
' copied. If only part of a single field is selected, that field only is copied to the
' Clipboard. A selection (whether of a single field or of several fields) that contains
' non-Latin script is not copyable. In this case, the macro offers the option of copying
' the whole record instead.
'
' The first line of the copied text identifies the source of the record--WorldCat,
' Authority File, Save File (including the save file number), or Constant Data. The
' record itself is presented as displayed on the screen, with the fixed field with its
' mnemonics either at the top or the bottom, or displayed as a variable field. If the
' fixed field shows at the top, the copied record is laid out in the classic OCLC record
' display, and if a monospaced font is used, the layout is properly spaced and aligned.
'
' The limited capabilities of the ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 character set require conversion or
' substitution for an intelligible display. These conversions are generally made on the
' basis of visual similarity, rather than of logical appropriateness. The vertical bar
' "|" is used to represent characters for which no appropriate substitute is available.
' Conversions or substitutions made by this macro include:
'
'  + Delimiters are represented by dollar signs. The dollar sign in subfield $c in the
'    066 field, part of a code indicating the presence of Chinese, Japanese, or Korean
'    script, is doubled, as otherwise it would look like subfield "one". Elsewhere, the
'    context should make it apparent which dollar signs actually represent themselves.
'  + Fill characters are converted to asterisks.
'  + Characters in the record modified with diacritical marks are represented by their
'    unmodified forms (that is, the diacritics are simply omitted) if they have no
'    precomposed equivalent in the character set.
'  + Most joined letters (including those connected with ligatures) are represented by
'    their separated components.
'  + The sound recording copyright symbol is represented by the letter "p".
'  + The musical flat sign is converted to the word "[flat]".
'  + Superscript and subscript numbers and symbols are converted to normal forms.
'
' Script direction is always displayed in the copied record or field as left-to-right.
' (Characters in scripts written from right to left generally won't display anyway.)
'
' Links between fields, shown in the client by a bracket connecting the two fields, can't
' be displayed by the macro.
'
' A brief warning about any conversion issues is included in the copied text.
'
' Because of the limitations of OCLC's macro language, a record longer than about 32K
' characters is beyond the capabilities of this macro. The record is stored in a single
' string, whose length cannot be greater than 32,767 characters; but OML has a memory
' limit somewhat less than that.
'
' Characters with code points 32 to 127 are common to all versions of ASCII, as well as
' ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 and OCLC-MARC; this macro will copy them exactly. Characters with
' code points 128 to 255 are expected to be OCLC-MARC characters, which are encoded
' differently than ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998. Some characters will copy exactly, but most will
' either not copy at all, or be approximated. For example, the character encoded as
' decimal 228 is the combining tilde in OCLC-MARC, but the letter "ä" otherwise, as it
' might be if copied from outside Connexion. If the character is not the tilde, it won't
' copy properly. (My macro "Decompose" can turn most of these precomposed characters into
' their OCLC-MARC equivalents.) Diacritics in OCLC-MARC only appear if their combination
' with a base character matches a precomposed character in ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998; if not,
' only the base character is kept. Code points above 255 should be encoded in a MARC
' record as Numeric Character References (NCR). An NCR has the form "&#x?;", where the
' question mark stands for one or more hexadecimal digits. Almost none of these
' characters (which number more than a million) will have a direct ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998
' equivalent. A few can be approximated, but most will simply not be able to display, and
' so are represented by this macro by a vertical bar "|".
'
' The macro acquires the record's data with the "GetFieldUnicode" command, which
' retrieves Unicode characters encoded as NCRs. Valid NCRS are converted to ISO/IEC
' 8859-1:1998 by means of a table that matches those Unicode characters to ISO/IEC
' 8859-1:1998 characters. This table contains 898 Unicode characters that may be
' represented, more or less closely, by ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 characters, drawn from these
' Unicode blocks: Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended-A, Latin Extended-B,
' Latin Extended-C, Latin Extended-D, Latin Extended-E, Latin Extended Additional, and
' General Punctuation.
'
' The macro makes note of the three cases in which the correspondence between the
' record's characters and the ISO/IEC 8859-1:1998 set is not exact, although this takes
' the form of a general warning, and does not identify any specific occurrence of a case.
' These situations are when a diacritic is unable to be represented in combination with a
' base character, when a character has only an approximate equivalent, and when a
' character has no appropriate representation at all.
'
' If a selection includes non-Latin characters, the OML command "CS.GetSelectedText"
' returns the value "Data contains non-latin script", no matter how many fields have been
' selected. Because there is no data to copy in the selection, the macro can only offer
' to copy the whole record instead.
