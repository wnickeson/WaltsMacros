'MacroName:DeriveBookFromAnyFormat.2022.04
'MacroDescription:Derives a new record in books format from a bibliographic record of any
' format, or changes the format of a bibliographic record to "books." Fields not
' appropriate in books format are deleted, and default books format workform values are
' supplied where information is lacking.

'
'****************************************************************************************!
' How it works: Run the macro in a bibliographic record for something other than a book--
' that is, something that is not monographic printed language material--to produce an RDA
' (ISBD) record for a book manifestation. Choose to derive a new record or simply adapt
' the original one. Whether the record is new or adapted, the macro helps in editing by
' removing fields inappropriate or irrelevant for describing books. Use this macro when
' describing a book, and a record already exists for another type of resource--such as a
' microform, a serial, an online PDF, or the movie from which the book was made--that has
' so much relevant and useful information that it would be easier to tweak the record
' than to enter the data all over again.
'
' The macro strips all fields with tags below 033, with two exceptions. An 010 field is
' retained if the record is edited, but in a new record, its content is moved to 776
' subfield $w. All ISBNs are retained in the 020 fields if the record is edited; if a new
' record is created, invalid ISBNs are deleted, and valid ones moved to a 776 field. For
' fields from 033 on up, the macro deletes those that are format-specific or don't apply,
' such as 047 (Form of Musical Composition Code), 310 (Current Publication Frequency),
' 346 (Video Characteristics), 382 (Medium of Performance), 538 (System Details Note),
' etc. General notes (in 500 fields) are retained, but because they may not really be
' appropriate for a book, they need to be carefully reviewed. Name headings containing
' relator terms not applicable to printed language resources ("composer," "actor", etc.)
' are removed. All subject headings containing a subfield $2 are deleted, as are all 6XX
' fields on records for music materials. Also in the 6XX fields, some form subdivisions
' indicating non-book materials, such as "Periodicals," "Maps," "Films for...", etc., are
' removed, leaving the base subject heading intact. The macro discards all 7XX linking
' fields except 776. Any field containing a subfield $5, denoting information applicable
' to a specific institution, is deleted. All series fields are removed. The complete list
' of fields to be retained is found below starting on line 358.

' Subfield $e "rda" is added to the 040 field, as well as subfield $b "eng". In a record
' that is to be edited, any other codes for description conventions are retained.
'
' Some edits are made to the fixed field in addition to changing "Type"--for example,
' "Form" is always made blank. A new record will always have "s" for the value of "DtSt",
' and only the first date in "Dates" is retained; an edited record retains the original
' values for the date elements. If fixed field information is lacking in the original
' record (for example, codes for illustrations, which would be irrelevant for a sound
' recording), the default values for a books workform will appear. A books 006 field will
' be deleted, but information may be extracted from it for the fixed field.
'
' The new or edited record's 33X fields will describe an unmediated textual resource
' whose carrier is either "volume", "sheet", or "card". The corresponding code is used
' along with the term in each of the three fields. A fill character is used as the first
' indicator in the 338 field as a reminder to verify the type of carrier, as the macro
' can't be sure if the term it supplies is actually correct.
'
' A 776 field will only be created when deriving a new record from an original that
' also describes language material--so, for example, no 776 field will be added when
' deriving a new record from one for visual material. An added 776 field begins with
' text in subfield $i: "Reproduced as (manifestation):" for a record describing a
' microform (on the assumption that the print resource is original and the microform a
' reproduction of it), or "Online version:" for a record describing an online resource
' (whose relation with the original may be indeterminable). If the original record
' includes a 533 field to describe the resource as a reproduction, that field forms the
' basis for a 776 field; otherwise, and also to add information not found in the 533
' field, the macro copies appropriate information (when present) from fields 010, 020
' (only valid ISBNs), 1XX, 240, 245, and 250, and formats it for the corresponding
' subfields in the 776 field. The final piece of data in the field is the OCLC control
' number of the original record, placed in subfield $w. If no 533 field is present in the
' original record, the 776 field will contain only information from the 1XX-2XX fields
' and the OCLC control number; a fill character in the field acts as a warning that some
' information may need to be entered manually. If the original record is to be kept, its
' 533 field is deleted.
'
' As always, non-standard punctuation in the original record will probably remain non-
' standard in the resulting record.
'
' If a record is simply to be edited, the macro uses the "ChangeRecordType" command to
' change the value of "Type", unless the record is already for printed material, such as
' a serial, or microform. If a new record is required, the macro opens a books workform
' and pastes into it relevant fields copied from the existing record. While the macro
' command "DeriveNewRecord" may seem to be a more appropriate tool in this case, the
' variable fields it copies depends upon the user's settings, found in the menu hierarchy
' "Tools > Options". By copying fields and pasting them into a workform, this macro
' escapes the limitations of those settings. For example, the default settings for
' deriving a record only transfers fields 1XX-8XX. But the original record may have
' important or useful information in some 0XX fields that should be in the new record,
' such as that in 043 and 050. If the default settings for deriving a record have never
' been changed, that information would have to be re-entered.
