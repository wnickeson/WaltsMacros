' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works: This macro adds whitespace to lines of code copied from a dialog box
' definition to align the coordinates of dialog box controls and other information. Code
' in neat columns is easier to read, and makes relationships between the controls in the
' dialog box much clearer. OML's dialog box editor produces a dense jumble of code when
' used to create a dialog box. This macro helps make sense of that mess. It can also help
' somewhat to align the controls in the displayed box.
'
' To use the macro: You do not need to be logged on to Connexion to run the macro, nor do
' you need to be working in the Macro Editor--except that otherwise you can't run the
' macro to check its results! Copy entire lines of code (no partial lines) from a dialog
' box definition. Use the mouse to select lines (anything between, and optionally
' including, "Begin Dialog" and "End Dialog") by clicking and dragging. Or, while viewing
' the dialog box in the OML Dialog Editor, you can quickly copy all the lines of code
' using the menu commands "Edit > Copy Entire Dialog to Clipboard". However, the macro
' does not require that the whole dialog be copied; it will work with any number of whole
' lines selected from it.
'
' When the lines of code have been copied, run the macro. It displays the beginning of
' the copied text for confirmation that what is on the Clipboard is really from a dialog
' box definition--and if it isn't, you can tell what was actually copied. It reads the
' text from the Clipboard and, by working from the commas in each line, adds whitespace
' to align the coordinates of the dialog box controls, as well as labels, IDs, and
' comments. All controls are indented two spaces from the beginning indention. Option
' buttons are indented a further space below the OptionGroup statement. If a ButtonGroup
' is defined, pushbuttons beneath it are also indented. The macro will also change the
' horizontal and vertical coordinates of the controls, if numbers are entered in the text
' boxes; the maximum change allowed is 999. To change the positions of only some of the
' controls, select only the affected lines from the dialog box code. For example, to move
' the bottom half of a dialog box down to make room for a new control in the top half,
' simply select those controls that need to move. (Because the selected lines must be
' contiguous, some controls may find themselves excluded from this action.) If moving
' controls means the whole dialog box must expand, such as when you need to shift
' everything to the right by a certain amount, include the "Begin Dialog" line in the
' copied text. Its size will be expanded by the same amount, and in the same
' dimension(s), as the coordinates of the controls.
'
' The unit of measurement in the dialog definition for all these coordinates is the DLU,
' which in the horizontal dimension is 1/4 the average width of the system font, and in
' the vertical, 1/8 the height of the system font. The actual size in pixels of the
' dialog box and its controls will vary according to screen resolution.
'
' The macro offers several options as it aligns the code. The first is to add the numeric
' identifiers of the controls. While it's usually better to identify controls with names,
' sometimes it can be convenient to use numbers instead, as when several controls appear
' in a regular pattern, and their states or values can be processed by some sort of
' iteration. Numeric identifiers appear as comments, starting at zero with the first
' control. All controls have numeric identifiers even if they are not actionable, such as
' text areas. All the macro does by adding the identifiers is make them apparent, so you
' don't have to count lines to see the number of any control, or use the "DlgControlID"
' function to discover them. If the macro has already added control numbers, and the
' lines have been rearranged, the macro re-assigns the numbers. If only selected lines
' from the dialog box have been copied, the macro starts its numbering with the lowest
' number found, re-numbering the controls in order.
'
' The second option is to what I call "optimize" the controls. This option does two
' things. It makes certain controls a regular height (according to OML suggestions): The
' height of text boxes and radio buttons are made to be 12 DLUs, pushbuttons 14, and text
' areas multiples of 8. Selecting this option also makes the macro attempt to align
' controls within the dialog box, not just their coordinates in the code. Controls that
' are within 8 DLUs of each other horizontally, and 6 vertically, will have their
' coordinates changed to align the controls along their left and top edges, respectively.
' Related controls, such as groups of radio buttons or checkboxes, are evenly spaced as
' they are aligned. Choosing this option makes the most sense when running the macro
' immediately after having used the dialog editor to create or edit controls. You can add
' controls and drag them around with the mouse to roughly achieve a functional and useful
' layout without bothering to position things exactly, and then run the macro to
' automatically do some of the lining up of controls as a first step in the editing
' process. However, the macro does not check for overlapping or even proper spacing of
' controls, and won't rearrange the lines in the code.
'
' The third option is to space controls evenly in the dialog box. This option works only
' on lines of code that contain controls, so the macro fails if, for example, an
' OptionGroup is is included in the copied lines. It is intended to help get correct or
' pleasing spacing for sets of similar controls, such as groups of checkboxes or radio
' buttons, although it works on any controls, whether they are the same kind or not. When
' this option is selected, the desired space between controls must be a number between 1
' and 8. In the vertical dimension, the space is DLUs between the bottom edge of the
' control (or of the tallest control, if there is more than one control on the line) on
' the upper line, and the top edge of controls on the lower line. In the horizontal
' dimension, the space is between the right edge of the left control and the left edge of
' the right control. Note that choosing too great a space between controls could cause
' some controls to be misaligned with respect to other controls, or to be pushed out of
' the dialog box entirely. This option will not actually create nice columns of controls
' in the dialog box.
'
' If these lines of code are copied:
'
' Begin Dialog DialogBox 304, 341, "Align/Change dialog box coordinates", .Controll
'    OkButton  193, 320, 50, 14
'    CancelButton  247, 320, 50, 14
'    TextBox  125, 26, 24, 12, .TextBoxHoriz
'    TextBox  261, 26, 24, 12, .TextBoxVert
'    Text  13, 26, 108, 8, "Change horizontal coordinates by:"
'    Text  17, 34, 96, 16, "(negative numbers move controls left)"
'
' and "-2" is entered for the horizontal coordinate change, and "8" for the vertical, the
' macro produces this output, copied to the clipboard for pasting in:
'
' Begin Dialog DialogBox  304, 349, "Align/Change dialog box coordinates", .Controll
'   OkButton      191, 328,  50,  14
'   CancelButton  245, 328,  50,  14
'   TextBox       123,  34,  24,  12,                                          .TextBoxHoriz
'   TextBox       259,  34,  24,  12,                                          .TextBoxVert
'   Text           11,  34, 108,   8, "Change horizontal coordinates by:"
'   Text           15,  42,  96,  16, "(negative numbers move controls left)"
'
' Note that the height of the dialog box has changed, because all controls were moved
' down 8 DLUs, but the width was not changed, because the macro will not shrink the
' dimensions of the box. Otherwise, some controls might find themselves outside of the
' box.
'
' In this next example, control numbers have been added. They appear for every control,
' named or not, actionable or otherwise, and the controls have numbers even if they are
' not shown:
'
' Begin Dialog Dialog1Definition  336, 172, WaltsMacros$, .Dialog1ControlFunction
'   PushButton    172, 148,  96,  14, "",                .AddReplace '0
'   CancelButton  274, 148,  50,  14                                 '1
'   PushButton     12, 148,  50,  14, "Re&set"                       '2
'   PushButton     69, 148,  64,  14, "&Update display", .Update     '3
'   CheckBox       18, 128, 280,  12, "",                .Replace    '4
'   GroupBox      232,  24,  92,  57, "Codes or terms?"              '5
'
' If no change in the positions of the controls is indicated, and neither option is
' chosen, the result is only the making of neat columns in the code.
'
' If the position of the dialog box on the screen is given, the macro ignores it.
'
' Blank lines within the dialog box, or lines beginning with the comment mark (a single
' quotation mark), are preserved.
