'MacroName:Show006.2015.02
'MacroDescription:Displays in user-friendly form existing 006 fields for confirmation or
' editing, and helps in adding new 006 fields for all types of material.
'
' This macro was written by Walter F. Nickeson,
' University of Rochester, Rochester, NY
' wnickeson@library.rochester.edu
'
' Last updated: 3 December 2015.
' Check for the latest versions of this and my other macros at
' https://github.com/wnickeson/WaltsMacros
' Please e-mail me with bug reports or to suggest improvements.
'
' This macro works for me with Connexion client 2.63 and 64-bit Windows 7 Enterprise &
' 64-bit Windows 10 Pro, but no guarantees are promised or implied.
'
'****************************************************************************************
' How it works. Run the macro in a bibliographic record to view the contents of an 006
' field, with textual explanations of the codes. If more than one 006 field is present,
' view the contents of each one by selecting it from a drop-down list of all the possible
' 006 forms, in which the fields already present in the record appear at the top. Put the
' cursor in a specific 006 field to display its contents first. Add a new 006 field by
' selecting an unused code from the drop-down list. Select appropriate values for the
' elements of that field from the drop-down boxes listing valid codes for that type of
' material. When done verifying or editing the codes, click "OK" to add a new 006 field
' to the record, or to replace an existing field, if changes were made.
'
' When adding a new 006 field, the default values for each element are the same as those
' presented by OCLC in the fixed field, which is essentially the 008 field. Each new 006
' field is added after any existing 006 fields, and they appear in the dialog box in the
' same order as in the bibliographic record.
'
' The macro enforces only a few logical rules for input. The most basic one is that it
' won't allow input of a duplicate 006 field. (But it will allow editing of such.) A
' duplicate field is not only one that repeats an existing field (so the macro prohibits
' adding a second field for a kit, for example), but also one that describes the same
' form of material as that coded in the fixed field element "Type". That means an 006
' field for language material, for example, can't be added to a record for a book. The
' other input restriction has to do with mixing of information for types of material that
' share the same general form. Because the general form "music" encompasses both notated
' music and two types of recorded sound, the macro shows three different sets of values
' for music materials, even though the defined elements are the same. Similarly, the
' macro separates the general form "visual materials" into four different sets of values.
' For example, an 006 field for "Musical sound recording" can't have a value for the
' element "Literary text for sound recordings," and the macro prohibits entering one.
' Likewise, an 006 field for "Two-dimensional nonprojectable graphic" can't contain a
' value for the element "Running time," and the macro disables the list box for that
' element. But the macro doesn't check for things like the relation between frequency
' and regularity for continuing resources, for example, which OCLC's validation rules
' will check.
